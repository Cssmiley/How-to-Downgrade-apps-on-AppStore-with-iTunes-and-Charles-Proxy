- The Guide seems complicated, but only need to do Step 1 to 3 for the first time. And there are 4 steps in total.
- Jailbreak is NOT needed. Since the iPA comes directly from iTunes, it's encrypted and can be installed without Sideload. The IPA is 100% legit.
- You can get the old version of any apps on as long as that version is still **available** on AppStore.
